# NeverSleep
A small utility program that keeps your desktop alive/awake when you are not actively using it without losing your "Available" status on Teams/Skype or any other team collaboration software.

## Origin Story
So basically, being an engineer comes with a lot of responsibilities :).
One of them is to be available all the time for your team during your work hours of course :P.

I have a habit of using multiple external monitors (2-3) attached to my computer or laptop. Many times, when I am working and reading or studying about something on the internet, I don't look directly into the laptop's camera (yes, it tracks you :)) and look at other screens.
Sometimes, I am oo much involved in reading or proofreading a code that I don't even touch my mouse for several minutes.
Resulting in my screen going off and my Teams status showing away that I am not :).

Having said that, it is self-understood that the display or sleep timer settings can not be edited on the machine.
So, "NeverSleep" came into existence.

NeverSleep allows you to do anything you want offline, while your machine stays awake and nobody gets to know :D.

This small command line utility has a few features as mentioned below:
1. It captures screenshots of your PRIMARY screen and saves them into a folder. The idea is to recall or cross-check the screen activity while you were away.
2. It allows you multiple flag options to delete the screenshots even on the run time. More details are below.

* You have to agree to the disclaimer and read the initial prompt before starting the execution.

* It creates a directory on your public folder to save the screenshots.
